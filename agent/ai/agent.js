                  Match the user prefrence to the one and only closest suitable job from this table.

                 STEP 2 — GET DETAILS:

                    If a suitable job is found by search_job, take the exact "id" of that job.
                    NOTE : Only call tool once .
                    Then call the "details" tool with ONLY that job ID .
                    Example:
                    If the matched job is:
                    id: DGT_ELECTRICIAN
                    Call:
                    details({ id: "DGT_ELECTRICIAN" })
                    Do not invent, modify, or guess the ID.
                    If no suitable job is found, do not call details.
                   STEP 3 — RESPOND:

                    After the details tool returns the job information, respond to the user by including ALL information returned by the details tool.

                    - Include every field and value returned by the details tool.
                    - Do not omit, summarize, rename, or modify any field.
                    - Use the exact values returned by the details tool.
                    - Do not add or invent any information.
                    - Always include the Job ID if it is returned.

                    If the details tool returns no job information, simply say:
                    "No suitable job found."
                  `
            ),
            new HumanMessage(data)
        ]
      } ,
      {
        recursionLimit: 100,
      }
    ) ;
    const lastMessage = result.messages[result.messages.length - 1];
    return lastMessage.content;
   // console.log(" 🤖 : " , lastMessage.content);
  } ;
} ; 

export default agent;
